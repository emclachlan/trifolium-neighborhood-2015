Goal: To test whether competitive environment alters nodulation patterns by rhizobia.

Hypotheses: 
1 - Nodules are larger when competition is more intense. (In this experiment, this is basically when there are more macraei in the community)
2 - Strain diversity is lower in monoculture (if something about root exudate diversity of neighborhood increases diversity of nodulating strains)
3 - Strain composition differs when plants at low vs high density (the preferred strain is influenced by the competitive neighborhood).

Raw data:
>>Emily, where are the raw sanger trace files? We should keep a copy of these with the fasta

Subfolders for every project are:
bin : binaries (external code)
data : DATA!
doc : documentation
results: RESULTS!
src : source code (scripts, etc.)

Within these folders, subfolders are arranged by date. 
!! In this README, keep a current version of the folder tree with explanation if needed

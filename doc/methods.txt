Experiment: Plants were arrayed in a 6 x 6 grid with 4 focal plants of a single species (barbigerum, bifidum, macraei, and microdon). The frequency of the focal species ranged from 4 to 36 (11-100%) of the total community. Each community was inoculated with a mix of pure rhizobia strains isolated from field-collected nodules of either the focal species (F1, F2) or the congener competitors (C1, C2). Two different mixtures were used for each inoculum type. 

Nodule sampling: Since the strain mixes differed for every species, we can really only test whether within a given species by inoculum combination the identities of the nodulating strains varied in response to competition. Furthermore, the plants within a single pot are statistically confounded. Therefore, for each inoculum (F1, F2, C1, C2) we randomly sampled 6 nodules from each of the a single focal plant within the low-frequency (4/36 plants) and high-frequency (36/36 plants). If a plant has fewer than 6 nods, record, skip it and take the next random plant in the set of four (in R, “sample(1:4,1)” will return a random number between 1 and 4).
Sample size: 4 spp x 2 competition x 4 inoc x 6 nods = 192 total. 
NOTE: If there are many (12+) nodules per plant, let’s pluck, size, and crush 12 nods each (6 in one plate and 6 in another) but just extract & sequence 6 each to start with. So we’ll have 4 x optical plates for nods.

Nodule sequencing: Dried roots were rehydrated in milliQ water overnight at 4C, then plucked into 96 well optical plates, scanned at 2400 dpi with a black velvet (?) background [EM→ test this] to obtain nodule size, and crushed with a flame-sterilized multicrusher. Total genomic DNA was extracted from the nodule extract (Zymo quick-gDNA) and used as template for a rhizobia-specific gene nodC (primers XX). Amplicons were bead purified to remove primer dimer and Sanger sequenced using (the reverse one, right?)

1. Harvest single nodules into 1.1mL 8-strip tubes*. Freeze at -80C with firmly sealed lids. 
* The layout of nodules to plate, and well within plate will need to be carefully tracked.
2. Add a single ball bearing and 100ul 0.5X PBS (I use blue food coloring to track any leakage).
3. Crush in tissue lyzer at 30Hz for 4 mins.
* Make sure you balance the tissue lyzer appropriately with blanks when doing small numbers of samples. *
4. Spin in 96well plate centrifuge max for 10min (could probably up this to get even cleaner).
5. Transfer 80ul supernatant into 320 ul zymo Quick gDNA genomic lysis buffer. Incubate 10 min at room temperature. [Zymo D3007 is uncapped individual tubes; 
6. Transfer to column. 1min at 10,000g.
7. 200ul pre-wash buffer.  1min at 10,000g.
8. 500ul wash buffer.  1min at 10,000g.
9. 100ul elution buffer. Incubate 10 min at room temperature and then spin for 30s at max speed.
10. 5ul as template in standard PCR.

Zymo protocol:
Step 1	
Add 200 µl of Genomic Lysis Buffer to 50 µl of blood, serum, or plasma (4:1).  Mix completely by vortexing 4-6 seconds, then let stand 5-10 minutes at room temperature.

Note:  Add 200 µl Genomic Lysis Buffer to all samples < 50 µl.  For samples larger than 50 µl, add a proportional amount (4:1) of Genomic Lysis Buffer (e.g., Add 400 µl Genomic Lysis Buffer to 100 µl blood).    

Step 2	
Transfer the mixtures to the wells of a Silicon-A™ Plate on a Collection Plate.  Centrifuge at ≥ 2,500 x g (5,000 x g max.) for 5 minutes.

Step 3	
Add 200 µl DNA Pre-Wash Buffer to each well and centrifuge at ≥ 2,500 x g for 5 minutes.  Discard the flow through.

Step 4	
Add 300 µl of g-DNA Wash Buffer to each well and centrifuge at ≥ 2,500 x g for 5 minutes.

Step 5	
Transfer the Silicon-A™ Plate onto an Elution Plate. Add ≥30 µl DNA Elution Buffer or water to each well.  Incubate 2-5 minutes at room temperature, then centrifuge at ≥ 2,500 x g for 5 minutes to elute the DNA. The eluted DNA can be used immediately for molecular based applications or stored ≤-20ºC for future use. 


Data analysis: Sanger reads were quality trimmed and aligned to identify SNPs. The frequency of each strain was calculated per plant and the per-plant communities compared using adonis. 
We also compared the reads to the nodC sequence from the strains used in the inoculum.
